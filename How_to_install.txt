- Extract all the files from the zip to a folder
- Now copy in all the images you wanna compress into the input folder
- first using anaconda promt cd into the current directory where u extracted the zip
- Run this in anaconda promt shell to install requirements
1st command: pip install -r requirements.txt
2nd command: python app.py
3rd type "n" if you want to go with the default setting ie 85% Jpeg Qaulity + 0.8 Res
4th type "y" if you want to go with the custom setting ie custom % Jpeg Qaulity + 0.8 custom Res allowing u to make the side sammer than u want
-You will  have all your compressed images in the output folder

# Note all the Output Files will have the Same Name as the Input Files Allowing You To Bulk Copy and Replace on Larger Projects.
Fork The code and make modifications if needed!
